    "The goal of making a useful investment algorithm is to maximize the expected return of the investment. With that being said, let us take a look at the investment period that is associated with the moving averages. It is a short ten days, which indicates that the moving averages are able to detect a short-term trend of the apple company after a year. To look closer to the data, I transferred relevant data from the code to excel and plotted two graphs: one is comparing the close prices with simple moving averages and the other one is comparing the close prices with exponential moving averages. By comparing the historical close prices with simple moving averages, I notice that 10-days simple moving averages fluctruate with the market prices from time to time, but the market prices are generally a bit higher than the simple moving averages. This indicates that the instrument is trending up and shows a sign of a bullish market. However, since the period is relatively short, analyzing EMA will be a better indicator on the performance for the apple. Based on the observation on the plot, EMA is relatively closer to the data points for close prices compared to SMA is. However, some of the general trends of EMA is very similar to SMA. In general, the trend of apple's market price is going up, with a few trend reversals. \n",
    "\n",
    "My investment algorithm is to buy when moving averages are below market prices and to sell when moving averages are above market prices. This is because moving averages indicate a bullish market when the market price is higher than the average prices and vise versa. With the developed algorithm, an investor can simply pay attention when the moving average indicates a change in the general trend of price movement. This works extremely useful for a big tech giant like apple because its overall trend is going up. Even though market prices sometimes go below moving averages, the general trend overpower these setback and indicates the price will bounce back from these downfalls. Therefore, investing in apple with an algorithm based on moving averages is a good way to go."
